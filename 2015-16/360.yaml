      The CIS is the academic home for students pursuing self-designed,
      integrative majors. Students propose a sequence of courses, seminars,
      independent studies, or experiential learning as the means of pursuing
      an individual major. Proposals must include:

      Each proposal must have the support of a faculty academic advisor. The
      coherence, depth, and feasibility of each proposal are evaluated in a
      Final Review Consultation (FRC) convened by the CIS, after which the
      proposal is forwarded to a faculty committee that gives final approval
      or returns the proposal for further revision. At the end of the senior
      year, the student’s work in the major is presented to a CIS faculty
      certification committee for review. Proposals for individual majors may
      be submitted any time during the sophomore year and the first part of
      the junior year.
