      Students may designate a selected statistics course OR one additional
      semester of a world language beyond the level of proficiency required
      for general education (French, German, or Spanish numbered above 232 or
      Chinese, Greek, Latin, Japanese, Norwegian, or Russian numbered above
      231 and taught in the target language) as one of their nine courses in
      the political science major.

      Additional study in statistics and/or a world language is especially
      recommended for students considering graduate study.
