    #     Three electives; two must be lab electives.

    #     The first must be from the approved list of Neuroscience Core courses.

    #     The second may be from either Category A or Category B. If the second is
    #     NOT from Category A, it must be from Category B and from a different
    #     department.

    #     The third may be from Category A, B, or C.
