      The Asian Conversation sequence (ASIAN 210, ASIAN 215 or ASIAN 216, ASIAN
      220) will count for no more than two courses.

      One of these courses may be an Independent Study (capstone project) or the
      Asian Studies senior seminars (ASIAN 397 and ASIAN 399).

      For students double-majoring in Asian Studies and Chinese or Japanese,
      the following rules apply:

      1. 231 and 232 can count for both the language and area studies majors.

      2. one 300-level course can count for both the language and area studies
         major.

      3. two level three language courses can count for both the language and
         area studies major.

      4. two of the three Asian Conversations courses can count towards the
         language majors with the third course counting for the area studies
         major.
