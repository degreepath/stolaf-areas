  Experiential:
    message: |
      This requirement is usually an academic, credit-bearing experience
      completed during the senior year (including the previous summer.)

      It is designed to ensure that concentrators participate in an experience
      that applies basic family knowledge (theories, frameworks, concepts) to
      real families in a setting beyond the classroom. It must be approved by
      a faculty member in the Department of Social Work and Family Studies
      prior to enrollment and entered into the Department GoogleDoc.

      The experience and concomitant learning is presented as a graded
      assignment for a public audience in the senior seminar FAMST 391.
      Through the experience, students demonstrate attainment of intended
      learning outcomes for family studies.
