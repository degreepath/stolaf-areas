  History, Theory, or Cultural Meaning of Film:
    message: |
      Two elective courses that focus on the history, theory, or cultural
      expression of film within the United States or in a global context.
      These courses examine the production, critical evaluation, cultural
      history, and reception of film. Students take two courses to develop
      fluency with the critical and theoretical methods of the discipline (see
      list below).

  Practical Film Studies:
    message: |
      One elective course that focuses on practical aspects of film creation
      or criticism. These courses emphasize modern film as professional
      practice, asking students to master at least one of the main creative or
      technical skill sets used in film-making (see list below).

  Integrative Film Studies:
    message: |
      One more elective drawn from the above categories, or an integrative
      film topics course approved by the program, or a
      contract course worked out in consultation with the program director and
      the instructor. This course challenges students to synthesize their
      previous study of film in ways consistent with their own needs and
      interests, emphasizing the interdisciplinary nature of film studies.
      Students must present to the program director a brief explanation of how
      their work in this course synthesizes previous interests.
