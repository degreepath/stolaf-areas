    department_audited: true
    message: |
      The capstone project introduces students to the career planning process,
      helping them to identify career options and assess opportunities. This
      project includes career exploration activities, a description of future
      goals, and an academic and experiential action plan, as well as
      projects, papers, and other work that demonstrate specific skill
      development. The students will enter their materials using Moodle and
      developing a LinkedIn site. By interconnecting important facets of their
      education and experiential learning, students can demonstrate the
      relationships between their varied learning experiences.
