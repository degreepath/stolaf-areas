        Students must complete two courses in economics designated as
        Quantitative Research (QR) courses.

        The QR designation indicates that the course includes a substantial
        research component that involves advanced mathematical and/or
        econometric modeling. These can be courses taken to satisfy
        requirements for the major, to fulfill requirements for an area of
        emphasis, or as general electives.
