    message: |
      For students double-majoring in Asian Studies and Chinese or Japanese,
      the following rules apply:

      1. 231 and 232 can count for both the language and area studies majors.

      2. one 300-level course can count for both the language and area studies
         major.

      3. two level three language courses can count for both the language and
         area studies major.

      DegreePath prepares automated audits; other audit paths are possible. Please 
      confer with your advisor and the Asian Studies department chair for clarification.
